Micro ESP-01 board for addressable pixel control, suits to every place and mostly to any needs!
Only a power bank and a smartphone are needed and you are ready to go with your mobile setup.

* Small : +- 14x32mm & Lightweight : +- 4gr
* ESP8266 based (Support for Arduino)
* Designed for common LED Strips like WS2812 with level shifting
* Connection over 2,54 mm 3 Pin for direct soldering, JST or screw terminal (Version Strip or Panel)
* Power and Progamming over USB (CP2104 nodeMCU design)
* User Input for One Button OR IR Receiver
* [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED "WLED's Github page") compatible
* Inspirations from Adafruit, Sparkfun and many others

Designed in Eagle, in a messy way! Sorry!

# Hardware

At the moment I have no possibility for a larger production and distribution. Of course, I am ready for any cooperation to industrialize the production. Happy to get any proposition.

## For DIY'er:
All you need are steady hands for the soldering part, specially the QFN. A reflow or hot plate is suggested.
The thickness of the board should be 1,2mm in order to sold the vertical USB firmly. The parts can be easily ordered from the common suppliers.

# First Steps & Ideas

⚠️Don't mess with the power - no polarity or whatever protection ⚠️

⚠️Vertical USB is fragile - Handle with care ⚠️
