üö• Micro ESP-01 board for addressable pixel control üö• ... suits to every place and mostly to any needs!
Only a power bank and a smartphone are needed and you're good to go with your mobile setup.

* Small : +- 14x32mm & Lightweight : +- 4gr
* ESP8266 based (Support for Arduino)
* Designed for common LED Strips like WS2812 with level shifting
* Connection over 2,54 mm 3 Pin for direct soldering, JST or screw terminal (Version Strip or Panel)
* Power and Progamming over USB (CP2104 nodeMCU design)
* User Input for One Button OR IR Receiver
* [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED "WLED's Github page") compatible
* Inspirations from Adafruit, Sparkfun and many others

# üî¶ Hardware

At the moment I have no possibility for a larger production and distribution. Of course, I am ready for any cooperation to industrialize the production. Happy to get any proposition.

## üó∫ Design Files

Designed in Eagle, in a messy way! Sorry! The related files are available under /Hardware.
Name | Description 
--- | ---
ButtonPanel | Panel and Button
ButtonStrip | Strip and Button
IR | Strip and IR Receiver
PowerRail | Power for 8 Strips
PowerDistributorX30 | 5 Ports XT-30 Connector

## üõ† For DIY'er:
All you need are steady hands for the soldering part, specially the QFN. A reflow or hot plate is suggested.
The thickness of the board should be 1,2mm in order to sold the vertical USB firmly. The parts can be easily ordered from the common suppliers.

# üìñ History and Evaluation

It started longtime ago when I wanted an easy way to drive my pixels. First pcb version was sended to fabrication in july 2016. 
Since the project evolved into something more advanced and more mature!

## üîç Development Phase
ToDo | Remarks
--- | --- 
Easy Boards | Design boards without programming chip but with easy to solder buttons and voltage converter 
Documentation | Improve the transfer of knowledge
Big production | Looking forward to have some input, help to release it massivly, if wanted.

# üõí Accessories
